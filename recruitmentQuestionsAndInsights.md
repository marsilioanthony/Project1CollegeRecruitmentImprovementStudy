## Basic Demographics-
## (1) How many students from each different class responded to the survey?
### CMP 101 Computer Information Literacy: 28 Respondents
### CMP 126 Computer Technology and Applications: 22 Respondents
### CMP 135 Computer Concepts with Applications: 81 Respondents

## (2) What are the gender percentages?
### Percent men: 39.69%
### Percent women: 58.78%

## (3) What is the racial/ethnic diversity? For those students selecting more than one race/ethnicity, assign multi-racial to their category.
### Asian:	8.4%
### Black/African American: 9.92%
### Hispanic or Latino: 23.66%
### White/Caucasian: 39.69%
### Multi-Racial: 14.5%

## (4) What is the age distribution for the survey?
### 18 and younger	33.59%
### 19-20	33.59%
### 21-24	16.79%
### 25-34	12.21%
### 35-64	3.82%

## Disaggregation of Data-
##  (1) I looked at how age spreads across "found CCM on social media" as 
##      well as "EITHER criminal justice major OR not"

### Age                         Drawn by Social Media	Studying Criminal Justice
### 18 and younger	            27.27%	                45.45%
### 19-20	                    20.45%	                13.64%
### 21-24	                    9.09%	                18.18%
### 25-34	                    12.50%	                6.25%
### 35-64	                    NONE	                20.00%

###   The insight here is that students "18 and younger" are studying criminal justice
###   in large numbers. Moreover, considering this group is the most influenced by     
###   social media it should pay to place some targeted advertising on CCMs' social  
###   accounts that draws a relationship between "criminal justice" and "technology."
###   This would suggest they should try a computing class.


## (1) A question I looked at was "what major shows the most interest in transfering 
##     to a 4-year college.

### After some cursory analysis of the data in Excel with a pivot table it appears
### that every single respondent cited interest in transfering to a 4-year college.    
### So, of course every major study is interested in doing so. On one hand, this means 
### there might be more analysis to perform. On the other hand, perhaps it's worth     
### keeping in mind that most people transfer and coordinating computer classes       
### accordingly.

## Basic Demographics-
## (1) How many students from each different class responded to the survey?
### CMP 101 Computer Information Literacy: 28 Respondents
### CMP 126 Computer Technology and Applications: 22 Respondents
### CMP 135 Computer Concepts with Applications: 81 Respondents

## (2) What are the gender percentages?
### Percent men: 39.69%
### Percent women: 58.78%

## (3) What is the racial/ethnic diversity? For those students selecting more than one race/ethnicity, assign multi-racial to their category.
### Asian:	8.4%
### Black/African American: 9.92%
### Hispanic or Latino: 23.66%
### White/Caucasian: 39.69%
### Multi-Racial: 14.5%
### Chose Not To Reply

## (4) What is the age distribution for the survey?
### 18 and younger --> 33.59%
### 19-20	--> 33.59%
### 21-24	--> 16.79%
### 25-34	--> 12.21%
### 35-64	--> 3.82%

## Disaggregation of Data-
##  (1) I looked at the buckets of financial aid impactfulness (High/No/Some Impact)
##      and the corresponding interest in Cyber Security classes.
##      (Note that I have excluded "No Impact" responses, as they hold little value
##       and represent just 30 percent of the sample)

### Respondents citing that financial aid was HIGHLY impactful, were 49% interested in Cyber Security Courses.
### Respondents citing that financial aid was NOT impactful, were 28.9% interested in Cyber Security Courses.
### Respondents citing that financial aid was SOMEWHAT impactful, were 28.9% interested in Cyber Security Courses.


###   The insight here is that students who find financial aid important are slightly more interested
###   in cyber security classes. Note that the "NOT" and "SOMEWHAT" financial aid groups     
###   are equal to the first decimal place in their respective interest in cyber security courses.  
###   Given the elevated interest in cyber security courses amongst people who value financial aid
###   perhaps it would pay to place literature regarding cyber security courses with literature
###   regarding financial aid (i.e. near the County College of Morris financial aid office).


## (1) A question I looked at was "what major shows the most interest in transfering 
##     to a 4-year college.

### After some cursory analysis of the data in Excel with a pivot table it appears
### that every single respondent cited interest in transfering to a 4-year college.    
### So, of course every major study is interested in doing so. On one hand, this means 
### there might be more analysis to perform. On the other hand, perhaps it's worth     
### keeping in mind that most people transfer and coordinating computer classes       
### accordingly.
